- Check if its solveable by sorting
- what if the array has negative elements - check for edge cases
- mostly try using hashmaps /sets
- try the two pointer approach 
- for the two pinter approach: mostly the array will be sorted or it will require you to satisfy a few conditions
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray
